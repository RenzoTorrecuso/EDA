# EDA & Data Analysis project

Below you will find a simulation of a EDA and data analysis service for a client searching the best strategy for his buying needs.

The client profile:

* He is a Seller.

* Invests in historical houses in best neighborhoods.

* High profits, best timing withing one year, may or may not renovate.

## Scenario & Hypothesis

On the 3rd of December 2020, someone paid US$ 450000 for a house right beside Snoop Dog´s one. Neither of the houses were made of anything else than zeros and ones...and status, a lot of status. Status is a useful tool to aggregate value to a product

HIPOTHESYS

 1. A ‘good’ neighbourhood has its house prices impacted by high status outlier in price houses. Not necessarily better than less expensive ones in the neighbourhood.

2. The higher profits may be in the surroundings of the outliers, with houses on even better conditions by half the price.

3. If Mr Brooks thinks the best timing is one year, maybe instead of renovating, it is better to find a house in good condition and close to a price outlier..

## How to navigate the notebook EDA_safe.

In the mentioned notebook you will find comments at each cell on the progression of what I did from uploading the data to the conclusion. Please have in mind that there will be lots of interactive plotly maps, so please zoom in to them.
Data

The data set, 'eda.csv', if from Seattle houses. Please refer to code for parameters.
In case you wish, please find attached a powerpoint presentation describing the strategy.
